How It Works
The app fetches your approximate location using IP geolocation (ipinfo.io).

It then sends an SMS containing a Google Maps link to your emergency contact via Twilio.

The UI provides clear status updates and easy access to mental health support.

Customization
Contacts: Modify the contacts list inside the code to add/remove emergency contacts.

Location: Replace IP geolocation with GPS hardware or APIs for more accurate tracking.

Alerts: Extend to support multiple contacts or other alert methods (email, push notifications).

UI: Enhance the interface with images, sounds, or notifications for better UX.

Security & Privacy
Your location data is only sent to your trusted emergency contact(s).

No data is stored or shared externally beyond the SMS alert.

Use responsibly and test your emergency contacts to ensure they can respond.

Future Improvements
Automatic alert cancellation timer.

Multi-contact SMS alerts.

Voice activation for hands-free emergency.

Offline mode with queued alerts.

Packaging as an executable for easy distribution.
